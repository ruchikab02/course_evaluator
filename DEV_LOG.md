<b>DEV UPDATE 12/3/21:</b><br>

Ruchika (rbiswas4) worked on data cleaning using a jupyter notebook to use the python pandas library. It is yet to be added to the vscode, but the data got merged from two files (fa2019-gpa.csv and uiuc-prerequisites.csv) and the unnecessary columns of data were removed. 
<br> 
Serena (stzeng2) also worked on the skeleton of classes and did research on how to best structure our code to implement our 3 algorithms.
<br> 
Romina (rparimi2) and Shreyansh (sj44) worked on the skeleton of classes, specifically Courses, Course, and Graph (.h and .cpp) and main.cpp. We also created a Makefile for compilation that is tied to each of the classes (in progress). 
<br>
Romina (rparimi2) implemented Dijkstra's algorithm and its test cases. She used and modified the Node, Edge, Graph classes and what was previously the Course and Courses classes.
<br>
Shreyansh (sj44) worked on Dijkstra’s algorithm as well as restructuring code for Node/Edge/Graph classes to properly set up the relations between nodes and edges for the construction of the weighted directed graph. He also developed test cases for the Node, Edge, and Graph implementations.

<br>
Romina (rparimi2) implemented Dijkstra's algorithm and its test cases. She used and modified the Node, Edge, Graph classes and what was previously the Course and Courses classes as well as modifying the Makefile accordingly.
<br>
 Shreyansh (sj44) worked on Dijkstra’s algorithm as well as restructuring code for Node/Edge/Graph classes to properly set up the relations between nodes and edges for the construction of the weighted directed graph. He also developed test cases for the Node, Edge, and Graph implementations.
 <br>
Ruchika (rbiswas4) first finished cleaning the data and then worked on restructuring the graph implementation and implemented a Betweenness Centrality algorithm.
<br>
Serena (stzeng2) also restructured the graph implementation with Ruchika and then she implemented a BFS traversal, updated the current Dijsktras’ algorithm and edited the makefile and data output.
