<b>Communication</b><br>
1) Team Meetings: Our team will meet once a week every Monday from 5-7 PM using Zoom. The designated note-taker is either rbiswas4 or sj44 (alternating each week).<br>
2) Assistance: We will assist each other via Snapchat, text message, and email. Outside of emergencies or other commitments, we commit to responding to emails within 48 hours.<br>
3) Respect: Each team member agrees to respect the opinions of other team members. Should any interpersonal conflicts arise, we will communicate amongst ourselves in a civil and obedient manner. If work conflicts arise, action will be taken amongst first with members, then with staff, if conflicts escalate. By signing this document, each member of the team commits to adhering to the decisions made, even if they personally disagree with them.<br>

<b>Collaboration</b><br>
1) Work Distribution: Each week, the necessary deliverables for the week will be determined by each team members' focus area and preference. Each team member must choose at least one task to work on for the week, and there should be an equal distribution of work.<br>
2) Time Commitment: To ensure an equal distribution of work, each member is expected to independently work for approximately 2-6 hours per week on the project. If a task ends up taking more time, the rest of the team members will help out, and work will be redistributed accordingly to ensure an equal division of work. Tasks should be completed according to the team timeline outlined in the proposal document. Tasks can be moved around as necessary depending on completion status and time restrictions. Any complications with finishing tasks on time will be discussed among members, but if further communication is needed, staff members will be brought in to assist with the situation.<br>
3) Conflict Resolution: All conflicts within the team will be decided on a case-by-case basis via communication of the problem and redistribution of work as necessary. Should any other action be necessary, staff will be brought in to reach a solution.
